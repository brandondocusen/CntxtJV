# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we pledge to make participation in our project and our community a positive experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Trolling, insulting comments, and personal attacks
* Any conduct that would be inappropriate in a professional setting
* Publishing others' private information without permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive or unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
